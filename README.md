# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project to showcase and practice skills learned in the HTML foundations part of the course.
Skills demonstrated should be multiple functioning local and remote links with pictures and ordered / unordered lists.
The goal is to create a basic looking website that is easily readible and simple to navigate whilst having structured commit comments and using the command line.
I will revisit and update the website once further into CSS/JS.
