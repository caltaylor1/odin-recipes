        <p><em>Bao down to the bao!</em> <br>
            <br>
        This is a recipe for one of my favorite treats, the hoisin duck bao, originating from vietnam and is now a classic pan asian dish around the world. Served in restaurants, food stalls or in your own kitchen!</p>
        <p><em>Fun fact, a lot of people call them bao buns but don't realise the word bao means bun, so don't go into a pan asian restaurant and ask for a bun bun!</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>corriander leaves</li>
            <li>sesame seeds <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <strong>Equipment</strong>
            <li>6 wooden chopsticks (brush them with oil)</li>
            <li>8cm squares of baking paper x6</li>
            <li>proving bag</li>
            <li>bamboo steamer (2-tiered)</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            Making the bao! pip the flour, sugar and yeast into a bowl and mix together and put to one side. In another bowl mix together the milk, oil, rice vinegar and 3 tablespoons of water.
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            Pour the liquid mixture into the bowl you put to one side with the flour in and it's time to get your hands messy! Mix it all together thoroughly until you have dough. If needed add a little bit of water, not too much though!
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            Empty the dough onto a lightly floured bench and kneed it for around 10 miunutes or until smooth. Lightly oil a bowl and place the freshly made dough inside. Cover the bowl with cling film, or a dish cloth and leave it for 1 hour to rise, or until it has doubled in size!
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            Whilst the dough is raising it's time to make the hoisin sauce. Place the sugar, black bean sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, Chinese 5 spice and 2 tablespoons of water into a small pan. Brig the pan to the boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer for 5 minutes whilst constantly stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved. Put the mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. Empty the contents into a bowl and leave it to cool.
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
            Hopefully now the dough has rised it's time to empty it onto your bench again, knock it back and sprinkle it with baking powder, kneading it for a further 2 minutes. Once complete divide the dough into 6 pieces.
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
            Place more flour on your bench/unit and roll each piece of dough into 10 x 6cm oval shapes, brushing the surface of each piece with oil.
            <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
            Place wooden chopsticks in the centre of each oval and fold the dough over the chopstick <em>(a few cocktail sticks grouped together will be fine if you don't have chopsticks)</em>. Place the squares of baking paper onto a baking tray and place the bao on each one. Place the tray into a proving bag and leave for 45 minutes until they have doubled in size.
            <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
            Whilst the bao's are raising heat the oven to 200°C/180°Cfan/400°F/Gas 6 and roast the duck for 40 minutes or until cooked through.. depending on how you like it! Whilst the duck is roasting cut the cucumber and spring onions into matchstick sizes. (I like to cut up some red chilli into rings to sprinkle on as well)
            <li><strong>Step 9</strong></li>
            After cooking the duck for 25 mins bring a large pan of water to the boil and carefully slide the chopsticks out of the bao's and place 3 bao's on their squares of baking paper into each level of the bamboo steamer. Place the steamer over the simmering water and steam for 8-10 minutes, or until the buns are puffed up and cooked through.
            <li><strong>Step 10</strong></li>
            Shred the roasted duck and mix in the hoisin sauce with 2 tablespoons. The delicate part... open each bao carefully without splitting it and fill with duck, cucumber, spring onion, coriander leaves and chilli if you want a bit of spice. Sesame seads are also great sprinkled on the top!
            <li><strong>Final step!</strong></li>
            Dig in and enjoy with your desired tipple!
        </ul>
