        <p>The beauty of buddha bowls are you can adapt them to however you please, adding or removing pretty much anything and it always still seems to be delicious!<br>I'm a big fan of peanut butter so this is a different twist to your regular buddha bowl that usually contains chickpeas, instead we will be using rice.</p>

        <p>This recipe serves 4, prep time 10 minutes, cooking time 30 minutes, total 40 minutes!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients / prep</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch squares</li>

            <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>750g cooked brown rice. <em>tip for rice, use double water to rice ratio, add rice and water into pan, bring to the boil, place lid and leave to simmer on a low heat until water has dissolved.</em></li>

            <li>450g baby spinach</li>
            <li>1 tbsp freshly chopped coriander (to garnish)</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame seeds</li>

        <h2>Time to start cooking!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220Â°C. On a large backing tray place the chopped sweet potatoes and onion with 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook until tender, usually 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whilst waiting for the above to cook, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Season the chicken with garlic powder, ginger, salt and pepper. Cook until golden and ensure it's cooked throughout, 8 minutes per side. Leave to rest for 10 minutes and then slice.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk the garlic, peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce and honey. Whisk in the sesame oil and remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil until it is completely smooth</li>
            <li>divide rice among four bowls and top each with sweet potato mixture, chicken, avocado and baby spinach. Sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds and drizzle with the amazing dressing before serving.</li>
